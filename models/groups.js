/**
 * This schema is to used for 
 * TAGS , 
 * USER GROUPS , 
 * COLLECTIONS
 * 
 * ! if doc ONLY has OWNER ---> it is a COLLECTION
 *   - can be private or not. 
 *   - nonPrivate can be added 
 *   - private requires invitation
 * 
 * ! if doc has OWNER & ADMIN ---> it is a GROUP
 *   - group can have single owner and single admin as same user
 * 
 * ! if doc has NO OWNER & NOT PRIVATE ---> it is a (PUBLIC) TAG
 *   - if user attempts to create new public tag that already exists,
 *     they add prexisting public tag to their list
 *   - accessing said list shows ALL posts associated - user's own is 
 *     on left, everyone else's on right
 * 
 * ! if doc has OWNER & IS PRIVATE ---> it is a (PRIVATE) TAG
 *   - exists so users can organize posts without shared access.
 *   - posts with private tags don't appear publicly. Can only be 
 *     accessed with a link
 * 
 * ?? on post upload, check whether any tag used is private. 
 *    if so, make post private
 *
